# GPG Tools

## RPM GPG Key Generation

The [`rpm_gpg_keygen.py`](../scripts/rpm_gpg_keygen.py) script generates GnuPG
keys with sane defaults compatible for use with signing RPMs.

### Requirements

In general, you'll need the [`python-gnupg`](https://pypi.org/project/python-gnupg/)
package.  If you're in a container or virtual machine, your entropy sources may be limited;
in that case the [`rng-tools`](https://github.com/nhorman/rng-tools) should be installed
as well.  Fortunately, these are both available as system packages on CentOS
and Ubuntu.

CentOS:
* `epel-release`
* `python2-gnupg`
* `rng-tools` (start service with `sudo systemctl start rngd`)

Ubuntu:
* `python3-gnupg`
* `rng-tools` (start service with `sudo systemctl start rng-tools`)

### Usage

Choose or generate a passphrase, ensure it's in a location you won't forget:

```
touch /dev/shm/geoint-passphrase.txt
chmod 0600 /dev/shm/geoint-passphrase.txt
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/stdout bs=128 count=1 | base64 -w 0 > /dev/shm/geoint-passphrase.txt
```

The example below creates a GnuPG keyring in `$HOME/.gnupg-geoint` with the identity
`FoundationGEOINT Packaging <foundationgeoint-packaging@maxar.com>`:

```
export GNUPGHOME=${HOME}/.gnupg-geoint
time ./scripts/rpm_gpg_keygen.py \
  --key-dest "${GNUPGHOME}" \
  --key-name "FoundationGEOINT Packaging" \
  --key-email foundationgeoint-packaging@maxar.com \
  --passphrase-file /dev/shm/geoint-passphrase.txt
```

Key details can be verified with the following:
```
gpg --list-keys --with-colons
```

Export an ASCII "armored" version of the key, this is how Yum/RPM consumes public keys:
```
gpg --export --armor > geoint.gpg
```

Export an ASCII "armored" version of the public and secret key for distribution:
```
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor > geoint-secret.gpg
```

### Additional Information

RPM signing is finicky -- subkeys can't be used and GnuPG is user-hostile.
This script aims to have some sane defaults:

* 4096-bit RSA keys are the default.
* High-quality algorithm order embedded in GnuPG key preferences (e.g., only use SHA-2 digest algorithms).
* Key usage limited for signing only.

The Debian/Ubuntu package `hopenpgp-tools` can "lint" this signing key:
```
export GNUPGHOME=${HOME}/.gnupg-geoint
gpg --export | hokey lint
```

Would produce output like:
```
Key has potential validity: good
Key has fingerprint: C18F F27A F995 0292 8732  2BC1 C083 6B8C E219 5F23
Checking to see if key is OpenPGPv4: V4
Checking to see if key is RSA or DSA (>= 2048-bit): RSA 4096
Checking user-ID- and user-attribute-related items:
  FoundationGEOINT Packaging <foundationgeoint-packaging@maxar.com>:
    Self-sig hash algorithms: [SHA-512]
    Preferred hash algorithms: [SHA-512, SHA-384, SHA-256]
    Key expiration times: []
    Key usage flags: [[sign-data, certify-keys]]
Checking subkeys:
  one of the subkeys is encryption-capable: False
```
